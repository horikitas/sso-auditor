# Read Me First
The following was discovered as part of building this project:

* The original package name 'org.horikita.sso-auditor' is invalid and this project uses 'org.horikita.rules_engine' instead.

# Getting Started
This project is a Spring Boot application that uses Drools to validate SSO configurations.
The application exposes a REST API to upload SSO configurations and get feedback on the validation results.

## Security Policy Evaluator – Rule-Driven SSO Config Validator
**💡 Problem**
Enterprise SSO setups are complex and error-prone. Teams often misconfigure identity flows, enforce inconsistent MFA rules, or leave gaps across environments.

**🎯 Goal**
Build a Drools-powered validation engine that:
Accepts SSO configuration objects (JSON/XML/etc.)
Applies security rules to flag missing, unsafe, or deprecated settings
Provides clear recommendations to fix them

**🛠️ Tech Stack**
Java + Drools (core engine)
Spring Boot REST API to upload configs and get feedback
Optional: CLI for MVP

**📊 Output**
Security rule violations in human-readable format
Severity levels (Info / Warning / Error)
Optional: Rule ID mapping to policy document references

### 🔍 What Exactly Is It Validating?
You're looking at security-critical aspects of how authentication and session policies are set up in enterprise SSO. Here’s a breakdown of real-world categories your engine could evaluate:

**🔐 1. Protocol Settings**
Validates the correctness and strength of protocol-level details.
samlVersion – Should be 2.0
encryptionAlgorithm – Should be SHA-256 or stronger
signingAlgorithm – Should avoid SHA-1
assertionEncryptionEnabled – Must be true

**🧩 2. Assertion & Claim Configuration**
Ensures identity assertions aren’t leaking sensitive or incorrect data.
attributeStatements – Ensure correct mapping (email, firstName, lastName, groups)
audienceRestriction – Required and must match app
inResponseTo – Should be enforced
notBefore/notOnOrAfter – Correctly scoped, not too long

**🔐 3. Authentication & MFA Policies**
Validates whether multi-factor and secure auth practices are enforced.
mfaEnabled – Must be true for external apps
allowedAuthMethods – Should restrict weak ones (e.g., password-only)
mfaType – Should include TOTP, WebAuthn, etc.
fallbackAuth – Flag if SMS fallback is allowed (less secure)

**🕒 4. Session Management**
Critical for reducing attack surface via idle sessions.
sessionTimeout – Should be under 60 minutes for most apps
idleTimeout – Set and enforced
rememberMeDuration – If enabled, must be scoped reasonably
forceReauthentication – Should be true for critical flows

**🛑 5. Misc Policy Gaps**
Catch misconfigurations or missing practices.
logoutURL missing → session might not terminate cleanly
disableSingleLogout is true → risky for federated setups
clockSkew handling missing → can break real-world SAML flows
